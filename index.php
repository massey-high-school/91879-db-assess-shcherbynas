                Having a varied diet means eating a wide variety of different foods from the different food groups, as well as within each food group. Each food group offers a wide range of choices and each one has a unique nutritional value.

                Diet diversity is well recognized as a key element of high quality diets, as it helps to ensure nutritional adequacy. When your child eats a variety of foods, it increases the likelihood of him or her getting the many types of nutrients which are important for growth and development. On the other hand, when there’s a lack of variety in your child’s diet (e.g. due to picky eating), it may lead to nutritional gaps.

                Your child’s diet may not be as varied as you think if he consumes foods from the different food groups, but only goes for a particular food within each group; or if he eats seemingly many different foods, but they only come from one or two food groups.
